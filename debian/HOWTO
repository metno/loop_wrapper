Short How-To from Heiko to Thomas on debianizing

The most important files for you are:

debian/control:  update once (or when you make large changes)
   Here you should add the packages you need after 'Depends:'. I only
added the standards: python. If you need additional packages, add them
there, i.e. if you need 'python-numpy', the line should look like:
   Depends: python-numpy, ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}

debian/changelog:  update for each new version and platform
   Version information, the last number (-1) should be increase when you
change the packaging/dependencies without any code. The first version
should be the one of your script.

The other files are boiler-plate files, I set copyright to GPL-2/ change
if you like.


What you need to do when you create a new version:

a) update debian/changelog file
manually, or use 'dch' from loop_wrapper_deb directory

b) do a 'git export' in /tmp
   rm -rf /tmp/loop_wrapper/
   mkdir /tmp/loop_wrapper/
   git archive master | tar -x -C /tmp/loop_wrapper/
   cd /tmp

The remaining of the commands are wrt to /tmp/loop_wrapper/

c) create a tar file including version, excluding debian (so that others
are able to rebuild your package), e.g.
   tar cvfz loop-wrapper_1.3.2.orig.tar.gz loop_wrapper --exclude debian --execlude test

d) run debuild in loop_wrapper, creating all the package-files
   cd loop_wrapper
   debuild -us -uc

e) upload to our repo
   cd ..
   dupload --to precise loop-wrapper_1.3.2-1_amd64.changes
see https://dokit.met.no/sysdok/linux/server/utviklingsspeil_reprepro


Package needs to be loop-wrapper, since debian doesn't allow _ in
package names.
